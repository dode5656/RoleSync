# DonorRole
 
Want to make your players verify their discord account with your server? You came to the right place!

DonorRole is a plugin that allows you to connect your discord server and minecraft server. Player can just run /donor command and get themselves a role in the discord server.

Currently MYSQL is not safe to use since I didn't optimise it.

This is my first plugin so bear with me.
